# AWQUA-breakout-boards
A catalog of basic breakout boards, for testing components that will be used in AWQUA water quality monitoring products.

After adding a new board, please update the folder `README.md` with a summary of the component's function and where it can be purchased. Also, please include the datasheet for the component, and match the datasheet and breakout board filename prefixes to the component name.
