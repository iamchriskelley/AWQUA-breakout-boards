###icsp_pogo_pin_holder
This board was developed to facilitate [In-Circuit Serial Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-system_programming). The board accommodates a standard 6-pin ICSP layout, with two additional pins (VCC, GND) for powering the device to be programmed. A pair of these boards spaced roughly 0.5 inches apart, and securely along the edge with stackable header pins, should be sufficient to house 8 pogo pins which will serve as the ICSP contacts. The cheapest suitable pogo pins I've found so far are available through [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BG6JJZY?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00).
